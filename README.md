## Working On: MLOps Engineer

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About Current Course

This repository contains files I made with Jupyter Notebook/Python Kernel. 
My current course aims on AI dev, but since I'm working on MLOps Engineering, the goal will be different - consider this a tracker 

Here's why I need to track my works:
* Time can't be reused, but I need to refresh when feel tired. I want to use my time as efficent as possible.
* Organized study can boost my speed. Roadmaps are important. 

Of course, my goal could be altered as time goes by; So I'll be adding more in the near future.
Thanks to all the people help me learning valuable knowledges!

Please look my profile README if you have more questions. I'll synchronize contents in both files.
